title: "Running evergreen version of a dotnet tool"
description: |
  dotnet global tools are an awesome way of packaging (in a cross-platform way) 
  little bits of functionality you need to easily deploy to users or CI. When 
  the tools are long-running, though, there is no built-in way to check for 
  updates and restart the tool as needed. This post shows one way to do it 
  reliably in all supported dotnet platforms.
