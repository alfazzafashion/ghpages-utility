### Stanford Javascript Crypto Library
<h1><a href="https://readloud.github.io/sjcl"/>SJCL demo</a></h1>
  <div class="header">
  <p>SJCL has lots of other options, many of which are shown in the grey boxes.</p>
  <p>Choose a strong, random password.</p>
  <h2>Key Derivation</h2>
  <p>Use fresh random salt for each new password</p>
  <p>Salt adds more variability to your key, and prevents attackers from using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table">rainbow tables</a> to attack it.</p>     
  <p>Strengthen by a factor of:</p>
  <p class="explanation">
  Strengthening makes it slower to compute the key corresponding to your password.
  This makes it take much longer for an attacker to guess it.</p>
  <p class="explanation">
   Key size: 
   <label for="key128">128</label>
   <label for="key192">192</label>
   <label for="key256">256</label>
   <p class="explanation">
   128 bits should be secure enough, but you can generate a longer key if you wish.</p>
   <p class="explanation">
          This key is computed from your password, salt and strengthening factor.  It
          will be used internally by the cipher.  Instead of using a password, you can
          enter a key here directly.  If you do, it should be 32, 48 or 64 hexadecimal
          digits (128, 192 or 256 bits).
        </p>
  <!-- mode controls -->
      <h2>Cipher Parameters</h2>
      <p class="explanation">
        SJCL encrypts your data with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"><acronym title="Advanced Encryption Standard">AES</acronym></a> block cipher.
      </p>
      <p class="explanation">
          The cipher mode is a standard for how to use AES and other
          algorithms to encrypt and authenticate your message.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCB_mode">OCB2 mode</a>
          is slightly faster and has more features, but
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCM_mode">CCM mode</a> has wider
          support because it is not patented.
        </p>
        <p class="explanation">
          The IV needs to be different for every message you send.  It adds
          randomness to your message, so that the same message will look
          different each time you send it.
        </p>
        <p class="explanation">
          Be careful: CCM mode doesn't use
          the whole IV, so changing just part of it isn't enough.
        </p>
       <p class="explanation">
          SJCL adds a an authentication tag to your message to make sure
          nobody changes it.  The longer the authentication tag, the harder it is
          for somebody to change your encrypted message without you noticing.  64
          bits is probably enough.
        </p>
        <p class="explanation">
           These parameters are required to decrypt your message later.  If the
           person you're sending the message to knows them, you don't need to send
           them so your message will be shorter.
         </p>
         <p class="explanation">
           Default parameters won't be sent.  Your password won't be sent, either.
           The salt and iv will be encoded in base64 instead of hex, so they'll
           look different from what's in the box.
         </p>
        <div class="explanation">
          This message will be encrypted, so that nobody can read it or change it
          without your password.
        <div class="explanation">
          This auxilliary message isn't secret, but its integrity will be checked
          along with the integrity of the message.
       <div class="explanation">
        Your message, encrypted and authenticated so that nobody can read it
        or change it without your password.
  </form>
